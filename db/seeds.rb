# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# creating users
# azdren = User.create(email:'azdreny@gmail.com',password:'1234567')
# foo = User.create(email:'foo@bar.com',password:'1234567')
# john = User.create(email:'john@example.com',password:'1234567')
# janed = User.create(email:'janed@gmail.com',password:'1234567')


# # Now creating posts 
# post1  = Post.create(user:user1,title:'Yay my first post',content:'this is my very first post on this site')
# # giving a like from the second user
# like_for_post1 = Like.create(user:user2,post:post1)

# post2 = Post.create(user:user2,title:'hello hello',content:'greetings from Jane just checking out')
# # giving a like from the first user
# like_for_post2 = Like.new(user:user1,post:post2)

# # now sending a friend request 
# friend_request = FriendRequest.create(sender:user1,receiver:user2,status:"opened")

# # now john commenting on janed's post wellcoming her to the new social network :smile:
# comment_post2 = Comment.create(user:user1,post:post2,content:"Wellcome Janed. Happy to see you here")
